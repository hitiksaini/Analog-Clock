# Analogue ClockðŸ•œ

## Project by [Hitik Saini](https://hitik20.tech/)

A clock or watch is called "analog" when it has moving hands and (usually) hours marked from 1 to 12 to show you the time. Some have Roman Numerals (I, II, III, etc) instead, or no numbers at all!

## Invention
Galileo had the idea to use a swinging bob to regulate the motion of a time-telling device earlier in the 17th century. Christiaan Huygens, however, is usually credited as the inventor.
